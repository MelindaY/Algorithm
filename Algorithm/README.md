Basically, this  repository is all about algorithm that I wrote, most of which are about interviewing and finding an ideal job.

The list of algorithms:

* Realize a queue DS with two stack
* Rotate a non-decreasing array, and return the minimum. Like input: {3,4,5,1,2} output: 1
* Print a list reversely
* Replace all the " " in an array with "%20"
* Finding a specific number in an ordered matrix (increasing by left to right, up to down)
* For any full binary sort tree with a depth of k, given any three element, output the  root of a minimum sub tree
* Fibonacci and its son. Like jumping in one or two stairs each steps, for any given stairs, how many choices. Place a 2*1 matrix in a 2*n matrix
* Crazy Frog. He can jumps from 1-n stairs each step, for any given n stairs, how many choices? I guess he has superpower
* Count the amount of "1"bit in a number. Negative with a complement
* Given its order traversal and preorder traversal, output the tree.
